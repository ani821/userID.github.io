<h2>Playstation 4</h2>
<p> 
PlayStation 4 has been out in the wild for a year now—and it’s been steadily growing since it first hit shelves last November.   
The PS4 interface has been smoothed a bit and improved in overall performance; an array of third-party games delivering fantastic experiences continues to expand;
 the list of heavyweight media partners keeps lengthening.Yet at the same time, owners have also had to deal with recurring service problems.
 Sony’s new system is selling incredibly well,but still seems to be searching for that one magical exclusive game. The controller, camera, and Vita each
 offer intriguing features that still haven’t been fully utilized by games or apps.Certain popular apps like HBO Go and Spotify are still missing
 and we suspect in some cases that this is because Sony wants to boost attachment to its own proprietary media services.
 So where does PlayStation 4 stand now, given that our original PS4 review is no longer as applicable as it once was? That’s where this re-review comes in.
 After spending 12 months with the PS4, it’s clear that it’s a system that’s still growing toward its full potential.
 But while there’s still plenty of room for future developers to explore the full potential of the system, make no mistake—this 
 is a great console that’s maturing into an even better one.
